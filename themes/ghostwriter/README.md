# Ghostwriter

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) usable theme originally created by [roryg](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter). The adaption for Hugo was accomplished by [jbub](https://github.com/jbub). I finally included harmonisations, especially to have a pretty blog at [higsch.me](http://www.higsch.me).
