<p>It will be about a lot of things, but mainly about my coding and electronic hobbies. In real life, I am a <a href="{{% relref "/page/about.md" %}}">bioinformatician</a>, so many posts will have something to do with that noble profession. However, I’m also interested in general coding tricks and building up small electronic devices. Stay tuned!</p>
