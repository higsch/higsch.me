## About

I'm Matthias and since a few months I've been living in Stockholm. The city of [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/se/), and [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se). All three are perfect places to relax and code at the same time. Actually, I'm working [here](http://lehtiolab.se) as a postdoc in bioinformatics to elucidate secrets in cancer research. I mainly use [proteomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics) techniques to understand why a tumor cell is a tumor cell. Before that I finished my PhD in biochemistry and bioinformatics at the [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/) in the [Sieber Lab](http://www.oc2.ch.tum.de). At that time, we tried to develop new strategies against multiresistant bacteria.

We are currently living in a data-rich time meaning that we can access millions of data points in no time. However, making sense of this data flood is a bottleneck, especially in bioinformatics. So, let's make information out of data. Higsch* information!
